# -LI-FI-Communication-System
This project uses Arduino microcontrollers to monitor lift temperature. An LM35 sensor on the TX module reads the temperature and sends the data via serial communication to the RX module. The RX module then displays the temperature on the Serial Monitor, ensuring real-time temperature monitoring for safety and comfort.
